## Learning different image processing techniques using Matlab, Mex, and C++

This is an an example of the image processing that will be explored (the first image is unprocessed, while the second image is obtained after applying a saturation and intensity filter):

### Another example of image processing: 

The first two images are merged with a mask provided by the third image.
